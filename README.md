# MockupToArticle

Project Instructions
====================

Review the Article to Mockup [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/145/view).

> 1. Download and unzip mockup-to-article.zip.You'll find index.html, the article mockup image (blog-mockup.pdf) and a file called reflections.txt inside.
>
> 2. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks **exactly** like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to [research](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough."). Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single `<br>` tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. The text should naturally wrap depending on how wide the window is.
>
> 3. When you've finished building the article, open up `reflections.txt`. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in `reflections.txt`. Answer the following questions:
>>
    >1. What new skills have you learned?
    >2. What has been easy?
    >3. What has been difficult?
    >4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
